# course-akka: Union of Akka-Scala courses from Lightbend Company Academy (https://academy.lightbend.com)

## LAS-P-lightbend-akka-for-scala-professional-v1: 
 In this course you will learn how to use Akka to create highly concurrent applications that are capable of improved scalability within a single JVM. These applications can have increased resiliency through the use of supervision hierarchies.

## LAC-Fundamentals-v1: 
Akka Cluster is a powerful set of tools used to build modern distributed and reactive systems. With it, you can build systems that can scale in ways that weren't possible using traditional architectures.

Using Akka Cluster properly can be challenging. An improperly configured cluster can create more problems than it solves. This course will attempt to de-mystify some aspects of Akka Cluster. We will peel back the curtain and take a look at how the cluster works behind the scenes.
